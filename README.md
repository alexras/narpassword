## A Metroid Password Generation Tool

I recently came across
[a video on YouTube talking about Metroid's password system][metroid-password-system-youtube]. I
looked around for online password generators for Metroid and couldn't find any,
so I decided to make my own.

The name comes from the end screen for Metroid, which asks the player to "pray
for a true peace in space".

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I
got technical details on Metroid's password system from
[jdratlif's Password Format Guide][password-format-guide], and transliterated
some of the bit-munging from the source for [mpg][mpg], which is why this is
released under GPL 3.
